A scrapper written in Rust to create practicals projects from David Bouchet's http://debug-pro.com website.

```
git clone https://github.com/SDAChess/debug-pro-scrapper.git
cd debug-pro-scrapper
cargo install --path .
```

The command to use it is now scrap-practical 


You have two subcommands :
-  ``configure`` to configure the software
-  ``pull`` to get the data
